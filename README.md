My notes on Introduction to Statistical Learning, version 2. 

## Notes

`book_notes.Rmd` is an Rmarkdown file containing references to individual chapter documents for notes. Some of the work is copied directly from the book, other bits are paraphrased, and relevant equations are copied down. To see the source code for the notes, check in the individual chapter directories. 

`book_notes.pdf` is the document compiled from `book-notes.Rmd` using `knitr`, and includes chapter and section bookmarks embedded within the file. Because of the extensive use of LaTeX equations, the `pdf` file format is preferred to a Markdown document. 

## Chapter Directories

There is a directory for each chapter covered in the notes. Inside of these directories, there should be three `.Rmd` files: 

- `chX_notes.Rmd`
- `chX_labs.Rmd`
- `chX_exercises.Rmd`
