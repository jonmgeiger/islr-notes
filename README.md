# islr-notes

My notes on Introduction to Statistical Learning, version 2. 

`book_notes.Rmd` is an Rmarkdown file containing all of my notes and code snippets from the text. Some of the work is copied directly from the book, other bits are paraphrased, and relevant equations are copied down. 

`book_notes.pdf` is the document compiled from `book-notes.Rmd` using `knitr`, and includes chapter and section bookmarks embedded within the file.
